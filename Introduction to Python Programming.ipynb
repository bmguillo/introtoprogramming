    "\n",
    "Those of you who are just starting out with the Python language there are a few concepts/tips that you need to be aware of:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Choose a good text editor, I choose to use Sublime\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use a python visualization tool to step through your code and understand what it is doing: http://pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=edit\n",
    "\n",
    "- The first is \"indentation\". This is how Python structures,groups and execute its code, similar to the old {} in other languages.If you do not indent properly you will get indentation errors or invalid syntax, perhaps so be aware.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Another helpful tip is when first beginning to write Python code such as loops(for & while), a good practice is to write one iteration of how your code semantically is supposed to behave then place it within a repetitive structure \n",
    "\n",
    "- Testing your code values and iterations using print statements for i,j values etc can also be helpful as illustrated below \n",
    "\n",
    "- If you have trouble executing the code below in this notebook , try restarting the kernel\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Tip: To execute the Python code in the grey code cell below, click on it and press Shift + Enter & then clear the cell's output (if you wish)__\n",

    "Prime number information: A prime number is a whole number > 1 that can be divided evenly (modulus/remainder = 0) by itself and 1\n",
    "\n",
    "2 is the smallest prime number and the only even prime number, it is divisible by itself and 1\n",
    "\n",
    "### __Step 1: Initialize variable i,p\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing that is done is i gets initialized to 2 (i=2) because \n",
    "    - a) prime numbers start at 2 \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "p is also evaluated as the total number to check in other to stop the outer loop from iterating indefinitely p=12\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### _Step 2: Outer while loop iterates\n",
    "\n",
    "The second thing that is done is the outer while loop condition is evaluated (while i < p), as p=12 it will run for values p=2 to p=11, 10 times.\n",
    "\n",
    "To prevent an indefinite iteration you must do two things:\n",
    "    - a) the while condition ( i < p) have to initialize to false initially by setting a p value to end it\n",
    "    - b) you also must be sure to incrementally increase the i value to reach the condition to not be < p \n",
    "            e.g. 12 < 12 is false, this stops the outer loop\n",
    "            \n",
    "### _Step 3: Initialize variable j, Evaluation of nested while loop and if statement conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "2 is also the lowest prime number in order to check for other divisors other than (1,itself) so it is initialized to j, j=2\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### _Step 4: Incrementing the value i and outer while loop iterates again since condition is true\n",
    "\n",

    "j > i/j is 2 > 3/2 or 2 > 1.5 so i gets incremented and prints the statements indicating 3 a prime number is found, i=4 now\n",
    "\n",
    "### _Step 6: Outer loop interates, Nested while loop condition is evaluated to true so print statement executes \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### _Step 7: Incrementing j variable, evaluation of the nested while loop condition again, which is false then jumps to next line of code: if statement to evaluate if prime number is found then increments i\n",

    "After it breaks out of the loop it jumps to the next statement incrementing j then to the if statement\n",

    "    - Each time the function calls itself(instance) it stores the state of n and variables in a different stack frame\n",
    "    - When the function reaches the base case <1 it returns the value 1 and control to the function just called and pops it from the stack\n",
    "    - It continues this process , returning the new total until it returns to the original calling function\n",
